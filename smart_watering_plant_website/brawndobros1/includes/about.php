                <p class="text-center">By measuring the soil moisture level, we can decide if the plant needs to be watered. To measure the soil moisture, we will use a soil moisture sensor. The sensor measures the percentage of moisture present in the soil.</p>
				<p class="text-center">Another vital resource for growth of the plant is the amount of sunlight it receives. By measuring the intensity of light reaching the plant, we can determine if the requirements of the plant is met. An ambient light intensity sensor can be used to measure the amount of light incident on the plant.</p>
